tvcure is an R package for estimating proportional hazards cure models with time-varying covariates using the counting process data structure.

## Installation

tvcure can be installed from GitHub using the devtools package by running the following code:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gwilliford/tvcure")
```

## Examples

Example code can be found on several of my other GitHub pages. 

- The article and code found [here](https://github.com/gwilliford/Proportional-Hazards-Cure-Models) describe the proportional hazards cure model, discuss its uses, and present an analysis of civil conflict peace duration and conflict recurrence. 
- An analysis of the influence of trade on the peaceful termination of international disputes can be found [here](https://github.com/gwilliford/Trade-and-Peace).
- An example that analyzes the causes of international territorial disputes can be found [here](https://github.com/gwilliford/Territory-Claim-Onset).
