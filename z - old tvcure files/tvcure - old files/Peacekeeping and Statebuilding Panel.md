Domestic police - domestic police and training components

Shared sovereignty - some domestic governance come w/ that status

Phases
- Creation of joint venture
    - need for international support overwhelms resistance to shared sovereignty
        - foised on authorities
        - domestic security crises
        - POC mandates
- Mandates
- Implementation

# 2
What role can interveners use to establish ROL after civil war
UN missions are simultaneously catlyys for state reform at the national leel - and surrogates for reformed states at local level
- Restructuring domestic institutions
- Peacekeepers model what states look like at local level
    - Civilians get a sense of what states might look like - the UN is acting out the state
FInds - UN presence stronlgy positively correlated w/ ROL after fighting stops
especially for polcie and judicial
Increased willingness to rely on state authoritizes to resolve crime and violence
Reduces reliance on illegal mech of dispute resolution

# 3
## Effectiveness Rates
Reduce civ casualties
Reduce mil deaths
Restrict conflict geographically
Reduce local conflict
Reduce spread of conflict across borders

## How do PK keep peace?
Allow beliigernats to setp back from violence and mediate - contingent on seucirty guaranee
In reality, PK has never done this - not a military endeavor - troops, but don't speak same language, don't trade together, not interoperabble - Chain of command doesn't work - one coutries commander will ask others to engge - refuse, take vacaioins in middle of operatstion

Three means of power
- Persuade
    - mediate, training
    - ideational means of helping
- Inducement
- Coercion - short of compellance
    - don't exersies compellant forces
    - defend, surveil, arrest - dont' take out rebels offensively

## PK + COIN
PK are impartial, deploy w/ conent of all parties, only use force in self-defense or defense of civialians

COIN
- always partial - take sides - intervention on behalf of gov to defeat insurgents
- consent only from one side
- heavily coercive

Moves to mix the two
- UNSC resolutions
- Stabilization - discursive mixing of langugage
- Kigali principles - use force to protect civ - pk don't hesitate to use force
- Cruz Report
    - General Santos Cruz
    - uses force to take out rebels before they kill troops
    - overwhleming force to be proactive and preventive - rules beyond even COIN
- PK works better than COIN - rates of effectiveness decrease over 100 years

Question - interaciton b/t the two

## summary
PK are not counterinsurgents
PI and CoIN mixing --> more civ and pk casualties
Division of labor makes sense

Delegation relationship - state delegates to intervening actors - what is nature of relationship in delegation agreements
Puzzle: How do seemlingly "weak states" control 3rd party actors?
Typically portrayed as intervening actors impose norms, values, and images of states on weak states and critquied fore an insufficient level of local buy-in - and they are immutably hierarhcial reatlinship - delegation isn't regracted
Particular type of contractural agreement gives more power to weak state

Theory: delegation agreements
Host states allow another actor (IOs, INGOS, bilateral donors, other states) to perform certain state functions
Limited to particular time periods

Produced by incomplete contracts
Liberalism made contracts a convenient way to establish these relationships
IOs and odnors sign on to avoid frocing their way and gaining legitimacy - INGOs need this to intervene at all

Contracts allow host states to 
- reduce scope of delegation
- delay implementation of contracts
- alter scope of contract after put in place

Inocmplete
- underspecified - can't wirte a contract about every relvant thing
- require continued neogtiation during impelmentation and often establish processes for tihs
- state can reclaim sovereign authority ovr time

Incentives
- host govt has an interest in demonstratiing soveriegn authority,esp. when weak
