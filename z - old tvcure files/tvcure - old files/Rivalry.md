Diehl and Goertz (2000) -- 

Vasquez and Leskiw (2001) -- 

Tir and Diehl (2002) -- Do territory and contiguity matter for rivalry onset. Most rivalries are not fought between neighbors or over territory, but most proto or enduring rivalries are. Both also increase the frequency of conflict between rivals and the chances of serious rivalry development (<span style="color:aqua">unsure what this means</span>). Rivalry severity is a function of territory, but not proximity.

Rider (2009) -- Territorial stakes make rivals more likely to engage in arms races. Unsure why the sample is limited to rivals (although this may help deal with problems in the coding of an arms race measure)?

Dryer (2010) -- Territorial rivalries endure due to broad domestic support. Regime rivalries tend to be short lived (either due to leadership turnover or lack of domestic support for the rivalry).

Mitchell and Thies (2011) -- Issue rivalries. 
* Issue rivalries = multiple contentious issues under dispute at a given time. 
* Militarized rivalry = two or more previous militarized incidents over a single issue claim.
* Both are more likely to use force and negotiate than those who experience contentious issues in non-rivalry settings.
* However, issue rivals are less likely to experience high levels of violence (fatalities or wars). 

Rider, Findley, and Diehl (2011) -- Arms races are more frequent in enduring rivalries, particularly in the middle and later stages of rivalry. They are also more frequent in rivalries with war than those without war. Arms races only increase the chances of war in the later phases of rivalries.

Diehl and Goertz (2012) -- Chapter in What do we Know about War? on how rivalries are sustained and terminated.

Valeriano (2012) -- Chapter in What do we Know about War? on how rivalries are intiated.

Dryer (2015) -- Issue conflict accumulation. Rivals tend to accumulate conflicts over multiple issues. Once a state perceives another state as non-threatening, states start linking issues. Issue accumulation increases the likelihod of MIDs and war. Gradual issue accumulation promotes violent conflict, suggesting that historical evolution is key. Territory linked with other issues is particularly dangerous.

Rider and Owsiak (2015) -- Unsettled borders increase the probability of rivalry onset. Border territory with strategic or economic value increases has a particularly strong effect due to the committment problems inherent in this territory.

# Territory and Rivalry

Rivalries must involve repeated contests over the same issues (KGD2006).
Enduring rivalries are disproportionately composed of disputes over territorial issues (Tir and Diehl 2002).
Territory generates more violent conflict than less salient issues (many cites).
The stakes involved or the salience of the rivalry issues must be great enough to justify the costs and risks of rivalry (Goertz Diehl and Jones 2005).
Because territory is highly salient, states are less likely to compromise over territorial issues (Vasquez 2004).
Domestic audiences also resist compromises over territory, especially that with intangible value (Vasquez 2004 or Goertz Diehl and Jones 2005).
Territory is hard to acquire by force (Goertz and Diehl 1992).
Every dispute in a rivalry does not have to concern territory, but a significant number may be necessary for rivalry development (Valeriano 2003).
Territory extends the duration of the rivalry (GDJ2005)
Territory tends to drive contiguous rivalries, while positional rivalries are more likely to involve more general issues (CRT2008).
"`Territorial issues tend to generate realpolitik responses (Hensel 2000) due to the symbolic and abstract qualities of the territory under question. Rarely is a territorial dispute fought over a tract of land with a sure value; instead territorial disputes tend to be fought over desolate or inaccessible locations. While territory is concrete and divisible, in practice the disputes over territorial questions are never very simple to solve because of their transcendent properties." (Valeriano 2012)

# Rivalry Typology
A **proto-rivalry** 

An **enduring rivalry** 

# Rivalry Process and Maintenance
Approach 1: Punctuated Equilibrium - Structural influences (e.g. issues) and consistency/stability of interactions over time influence rivalry dynamics.

## Evolutionary Approach
The **evolutionary approach** to rivalry states that rivalry is not inevitable or predetermined by structural conditions, but is a dynamic phenomenon and changes over time. Interactions in the early stage of a rivalry determine whether two states become *enduring rivals* or not, as well as the duration and severity of their conflictual relationship. Two influences are key: the general history of past relations between two states (e.g. number of past confrontations and history of peaceful settlement attempts) and specific details of recent interactions between them (e.g. the outcome and severity of recent confrontations). Hensel (1999) is the primary scholar associated with this approach. 

Specific behavioral predictions (Hensel 1999):
* States that have had to engage in frequent conflict in the past or have a longer history of conflict are more likely to engage in conflict in the near future.
* The most stable situations should follow decisive disputes and compromises. Where neither of these occur, future conflict is more likely.
* Severity also matters. Disputes that reach higher levels of escalation are expected to lead to less future conflict.
* Disagreements over highly salient issues are expected to lead to greater suspcion and more hostility and therefore lead to more conflict. Less salient states may be ignored, regardless of the frequency or severity of past disputes. 
* Characteristics of the states are not central to the theory but may act as constraints on the process.
    * Two democracies are less likely to resort to militarized conflict or war. 
    * States with asymmetric capabilities are less likely to fight than those with parity.
    * Democracies are more likely to settle if one state is weaker, while autocracies are more likely to fight if one state is weaker.
    * Arms races increase the probability of conflict after a rivalry has been established.

The two differ primarily in terms of how rivalries form in the early states and in the patterns of escalation they describe. Once rivalries are established, they are stable and not easily resolved.

Initial phase:
* Two outcomes: resolve disputes quickly or lock in (lock in --> enduring)

In the *stasis* phase, states experience hostile interactions with some regularity or consistency. During this period, rivalries experience a "basic rivalry level," an average level of hostile or cooperative interaction around which relations vary. Periods of conflict and detente are essentially random: they don't trend towards one extreme or the other. 

Rivalry processes are reinforced by domestic politics. In addition, states engage in coercion and conflict management attempts.

Territorial Salience and Rivalry

    Highly salient issues (e.g. territory) are more likely to produce rivalry than low salience issues.
        Previously asserted (GJD2005), tested?
    More salient territorial disputes are more likely to produce rivalry.
        Previously asserted (GJD2005), tested?
    Territorial disputes that are more salient for the target are more likely to produce rivalry.

    Expectations of future conflict vs. expectations of how one fares in future conflict.

# Salience Paper
More salient disputes are more likely to lead to conflict (and more severe conflict?) (Hensel 1999).

# Resolve Paper
Rivalries are protracted contests of resolve

Conflict is somewhat puzzling. Previous conflicts have failed to resolve the stakes of the dispute and will only do more to stoke hostility between the disputants.

The evolutionary approach to rivalry argues that states are more likely to engage in conflict and more likely to engage in more severe conflict following indecisive war outcomes or stalled negotiations. This is due to the fact that these outcomes are not decisive. Thus, the issues are unresolved and need to be resolved further in the future.

Nonetheless, this does not explain why conflicts occur. In the wake of stalemated negotiations or indecisive conflicts, states have little reason to expect that future conflicts or negotiations will produce different outcomes. As a result, we expect that conflict will only occur after there is a signficant change in the dyadic relationship that introduces uncertainty about the two disputant's capabilities and/or resolve.

This is similar to the punctuated equilibrium approach insofar as it places significant weight on exogenous shocks. However, this approach focuses on systemic approaches or domestic upheavals. By contrast, we focus on a) changes in capabilities between two disputants, b) leadership change (this is classic PE), and c) Third Party Rivalries.

Changes:
* Leadership change needs to be cut: it's straight up Diehl and Goertz.
* I think the other two are tenable.
